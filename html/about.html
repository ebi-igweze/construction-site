            Established in 2012, Masonry has been a construtor to major multi-national house builders. Our commitment to
            innovation sets us apart from all.
            From our employees to clients, subcontractors, partners, and our considerable network of contacts, building strong, resilient relationships is the key to our success.

            We want our employees to have the confidence to express and apply their unique innovations and expertise. We also believe in partnering collaboratively with our clients so together we can innovate beyond the boundaries traditionally associated with construction.
